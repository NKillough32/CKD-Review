CKD Staging Report Generator
This project is designed to generate patient-specific Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging reports from data downloaded directly from the GP EMIS system. By following the instructions below, users can streamline the CKD staging process, producing clear, concise, and individualized reports for patient management.

Features
Automated Report Generation: Generates personalized CKD staging reports for each patient.
EMIS Data Integration: Utilizes specific EMIS exports to ensure compatibility and accuracy.
Comprehensive CKD Staging: Includes detailed CKD stages, based on current NICE guidelines, and relevant patient-specific information.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
Required Packages: Install required libraries by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
EMIS Data Export
To generate reports, an export from the EMIS system is required. Specific EMIS configuration details will follow below.

Log into EMIS and access the report/export section.
Download the patient data according to the configured report criteria (see EMIS Configuration).
Save the export file in .csv format to the same directory as this project.
Running the Report Generator
Once you have your EMIS data file, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CKD-Staging-Report-Generator.git
Change directory to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd CKD-Staging-Report-Generator
Place the EMIS data export file in the project folder.
Run the report generation script:
bash
Copy code
python generate_ckd_report.py emis_export.csv
Output
The script will produce a report for each patient, detailing their current CKD stage and relevant information.

EMIS Configuration
To ensure compatibility, please follow these guidelines when exporting data from the EMIS system:

Fields to include: [Specify exact fields such as "Patient ID", "eGFR", "Albumin", etc., according to your EMIS setup]
File Format: .csv
Date Range: [Specify as needed, e.g., “Last 12 months”]
